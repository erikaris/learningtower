# Introduction

The PISA 2018 results were released on 3 December 2019. This led to wringing of hands in the Australian press, with titles of stories like [Vital Signs: Australia's slipping student scores will lead to greater income inequality](https://theconversation.com/vital-signs-australias-slipping-student-scores-will-lead-to-greater-income-inequality-128301) and [In China, Nicholas studied maths 20 hours a week. In Australia, it's three](https://www.smh.com.au/education/in-china-nicholas-studied-maths-20-hours-a-week-in-australia-it-s-three-20191203-p53ggv.html). Australia's neighbours, New Zealand and Indonesia, are also worrying: [New Zealand top-end in OECD's latest PISA report but drop in achievements 'worrying'](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/117890945/new-zealand-topend-in-oecds-latest-pisa-report-but-drop-in-achievements-worrying), [Not even mediocre? Indonesian students score low in math, reading, science: PISA report](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/04/not-even-mediocre-indonesian-students-score-low-in-math-reading-science-pisa-report.html). 

The data from this survey and all of the surveys conducted since the first collection in 2000, is publicly available. We have made a more convenient subset of the data available in a new R package, called learningtower, along with sample code for analysis, openly available. What you can learn by looking at the data, is that the variation from individual is vastly dominates any difference between averages. Focusing attention on the averages, can be convenient, from a public policy perspective, it detracts from paying attenton to the individual, and boosting opportunities for all. 

# About the data

Since 2000, the OECD has overseen a Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The goal of this programme it to provide reliable indicators of what people actually know and can do. Details can be found at https://www.oecd.org/pisa/. Every three years 15 year old students around the world are tested on standardised skills in mathematics, science and reading. The students are also surveyed on aspects of their everyday life, that includes resources, quality of life and study habits. In addition, surveys are conducted with the school administrators and parents, about resources and quality of life. 

The scope is gradually broadening, with more countries being added each three years. 2018 had results from 80 countries, double the initial number of 43. 

```{r collection, out.width="50%", echo = FALSE, fig.retina = 4, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.show="hide"}
library(learningtower)
data(student)

student %>% group_by(year) %>%
  count(country) %>%
  count(year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, n)) + 
    geom_col(width=1) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Number of countries reporting")
```

# Is it really this dramatic?

Richard Holden's Dec 6, 2019 article in the Conversation shows the figure below, along with an alarming statement "Australian 15-year-olds are now below the OECD average in mathematics, and our results in reading and science have fallen badly."

Looking at the data in detail can show alarming fluctations. However when examined at a larger scale, the results are not concerning.

- difference in mean is exaggeraed
- lowest score in australa has gone up for reading
- focus on improving the low scorers
